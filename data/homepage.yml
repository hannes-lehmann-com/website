  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I am an engineer by formation, creative, curious and energetic - that applies technology to solve real-world problems. Personally, Iâ€™m a very easy going, sociable, fast-learner, curious and natural leader. I do what I love, and I love what I do: find (simple) solutions for complex problems.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I am a deliberate jack-of-all-trades, master of none. My profile is a hybrid of technical and managerial experience, always related to technological projects. I bring business and product vision to tech teams, thanks to my experience in working as a consultant, building multiple consultant teams from the ground up, and finally starting and developing a company nearly a decade ago. I am a fast learner, curious to see how technology can improve user experiences in multiple areas. I have a strong motivation and sense of responsibility towards myself, my team, and clients (or peers). People appreciate my positive and easy-going, can-do attitude.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">    
    On the technical side, I operate as a specialized generalist, maneuvering between different areas to cultivate a holistic understanding of what it takes to develop a successful tech product. I initially served as an Integration Architect and Developer, focusing on TIBCO, and later transitioned to MuleSoft. I am not limited to the mentioned tools when it comes to development as I am also proficient in Golang, Python, and JavaScript. I have a strong understanding of databases, cloud services, and AI/ML. I have a keen interest in no-code platforms and web technologies. I am a strong advocate for automation, CI/CD, and DevOps practices.  
    </p>
    <p class="lead">    
    Throughout my journey, I have bridged the gap between business processes and developer teams, adept at grasping requirements, translating them into technical specifications, building and leading (off/nearshore) developer teams, overseeing testing, and managing deployments. I have a penchant for automating processes and creating digital twins that accurately reflect real-world operations while upholding data privacy and system stability. Additionally, I have contributed to building several Proof of Concepts across various domains, including web technologies, no-code platforms, databases, and AI/ML. With a keen ability to adapt quickly, I eagerly explore new technologies and tools to address challenges.
