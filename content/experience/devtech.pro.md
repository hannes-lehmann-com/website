### Building a multi-cultural team

During consultations at [sistemica GmbH](https://sistemica.de), clients often expressed the need for building Proofs of Concept (PoCs), Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), and more comprehensive solutions. While [sistemica GmbH](https://sistemica.de) primarily focused on consulting and quick PoCs to verify technology and business feasibility, there was a clear demand for a dedicated approach to developing digital solutions. In response, I partnered with three colleagues to establish [devtech.pro](https://devtech.pro), a company dedicated to creating digital solutions and products for clients. As the Chief Technology Officer (CTO), I have been instrumental in forming a multidisciplinary team capable of working across various technologies and domains, providing clients with a comprehensive, one-stop-shop for their digital needs.

My primary responsibilities include defining the company's strategic direction, selecting appropriate technology stacks, and creating initial implementation plans for projects. Additionally, I oversee the recruitment and selection of new employees, and actively network with freelancers and partners to enhance our capabilities.
