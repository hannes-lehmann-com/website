### Freelancing

During my freelance career, I engaged in a diverse array of client projects, enhancing my expertise across various domains. My responsibilities included on-site support, setting up networking systems, and developing and maintaining multiple websites. I also built custom software for agencies, served as a designer for real estate companies, and worked in Project Management Offices (PMO), where I managed meetings and coordinated project activities.

Throughout this period, I developed a strong proficiency in web technologies, further enriching my skill set. This hands-on experience across different industries and roles laid a robust foundation for my subsequent career in business and IT consulting, providing me with a versatile and comprehensive understanding of client needs and technological solutions.
