### Building a TIBCO consulting team

As Senior Director of TIBCO Consulting at nterra integration GmbH, I successfully built and led a dynamic team from the ground up, expanding to a group of ten highly skilled consultants. My responsibilities encompassed the entire talent acquisition lifecycle, including searching, selecting, hiring, and training team members.

In addition to team development, I managed budget oversight, cultivated and maintained strong client relationships, and played a crucial role in pre-sales activities and technical consultation during the project acquisition phase. My hands-on involvement in client projects ensured the delivery of high-quality solutions and enhanced client satisfaction. My leadership was pivotal in establishing a robust and effective consulting team, driving both team growth and project success.
