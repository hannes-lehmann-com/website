### From Freelance to Business Consultant

As a freelancer, I successfully implemented various client projects, which led to my subsequent role as a Business Analyst at univativ GmbH, specializing in IT consulting for clients in the financial sector and airline industry. This transition allowed me to gain invaluable experience in working with large enterprises and adhering to established processes such as ITIL.

During this period, I honed my skills in navigating and contributing to multicultural teams, enhancing my ability to collaborate effectively in diverse work environments. My exposure to large-scale operations and structured processes significantly enriched my understanding of enterprise-level IT systems and project management methodologies. This experience laid a solid foundation for my career in business and IT consulting, providing me with a comprehensive perspective on the intricacies of large organizational structures and their operational frameworks.

Additionally, I first encountered projects transitioning from monolithic, host-based systems to modular and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approaches, particularly utilizing TIBCO technology. This experience deepened my expertise in modernizing IT infrastructures, furthering my proficiency in contemporary integration strategies and technologies.
